## About
This is a Web application that hopes to help the next generation of college students have a smooth transition into the corporate world

### Description and Purpose

# Description:
Compass is a portal for CS students and early career professionals to find opportunities and connect with mentors. It consists of a job board and a post board for users to search and post opportunities. It is geared to help bridge the gap between students and the career they want to seek.

# Purpose: 
Compass is a CS community for students and professionals to connect with one another and share insights and opportunities. It serves as a space where people can apply for jobs, bookmark favorite posts and interact with one another. It also aims to increase transparency around programs that are geared for underrepresented communities so that they can easily navigate the resources meant for them.

### Inspiration
