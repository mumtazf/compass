## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I figured out how to read the data from a json file so I'm able to have a prototype of the posts page working

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
I had issues with CSS formatting so I'm learning how to use frameworks to manage CSS instead of writing it from scratch

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes. I planned to complete the frontend for posts this week and I was able to complete it

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

As of now it looks like I'm on track for completing the stories. I will update the project board as needed if I need more or less time

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
